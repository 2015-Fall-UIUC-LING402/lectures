Let's take a look at command line basics:

Using cp to copy a single directory

$ man cp

The cp command can be used to copy files and directories.

$ ls

Let's say we want to make a copy of the kenlm directory.

The first thing we might try is a simple invocation of cp.

$ cp kenlm wxyz
cp: omitting directory ‘kenlm’

What just happened?

We tried making a copy of the kenlm directory called wxyz.

If we run ls

$ ls

we see that our attempt to copy the kenlm directory failed.

By default, cp will not copy directories. 

$ man cp

To get cp to copy a directory, we must add an additional option when invoking cp.

If cp is invoked with the -r flag, it will copy directories, including their contents.

$ cp -r kenlm wxyz

$ ls

$ ls kenlm wxyz

As you can see, after the above invocation of cp, the wxyz directory now exists, and is a copy of the kenlm directory.
