Let's take a look at command line basics:

Use less to view text files

When working at the command line, it is likely that you will commonly want to view the contents of various files you are working with.

There are a number of programs you can use to accomplish this goal.

One of the most widely used programs for viewing text files is less.

$ man less

Like many programs you will encounter, the name less is a play on words.

Less was developed as a more fully featured replacement for an earlier text viewing application, whose name was more.

less can be used to view the contents of text files.

$ ls kenlm

$ less kenlm/README.md

Notice that unlike on Windows, on Linux, file extensions (such as .md, .txt, .zip, and .py) are not meaningful.

Even though README.md has an extension, 

$ file kenlm/README.md 

it is still a plain text file, and can be opened by less.

Likewise, even though setup.py has the extension .py, and it contains a python program, the file is still a text file, and can be opened by less.

$ file kenlm/setup.py

$ less kenlm/setup.py

less has lots of options. 

One helpful option is the display of line numbers.

This option can be enabled with the -N flag.

$ less -N kenlm/setup.py

Let's take a look at some other files.

Here is George Washington's inaugural address:

$ less /usr/share/nltk_data/corpora/inaugural/1789-Washington.txt

And here is Johnson's:

$ less /usr/share/nltk_data/corpora/inaugural/1965-Johnson.txt 

And here is Obama's:

$ less /usr/share/nltk_data/corpora/inaugural/2009-Obama.txt 

The text files don't have to be in English.

less is capable of displaying text in other languages.

For example, here's a Swadesh list for Russian:

$ less /usr/share/nltk_data/corpora/swadesh/ru

Less can also open more than one file at a time:

When using less to view multiple files, the command :n is used to navigate to the next file, and the command :p is used to navigate to the previous file.

less is one of the most commonly used programs you will encounter when using the command line. 

It is well worth your while to learn how to use it, and to learn some of its more commonly-used shortcuts.
