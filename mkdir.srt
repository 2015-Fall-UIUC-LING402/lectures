1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's take a look at command line basics: mkdir

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000


3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
mkdir is used to create directories.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000


5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
$ mkdir src

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000


7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
After using mkdir to create a directory, we can use the ls command to verify that the directory was succesfully created.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000


9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
$ ls

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000


11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
src

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000


13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Let's try again. This time let's ask mkdir to be verbose.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000


15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
$ mkdir -v bin

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000


17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
mkdir: created directory `bin'

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000


19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
By calling mkdir with the -v flag, mkdir prints a message for each created directory.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We can of course still use ls to verify that the directory was created.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000


22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
$ ls

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000


24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
bin src

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000


26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
mkdir can also be used to create multiple directories at one time.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000


28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
$ mkdir doc tests

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000


30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
$ ls 

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
bin doc src tests

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000


33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
If you attempt to create a directory, and a directory with that name already exists, mkdir will produce an error message.

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000


35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
$ mkdir bin

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000


37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
mkdir: cannot create directory `bin': File exists

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000


39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
In the previous examples, we created directories directly within the current working directory. It is also possible to use mkdir to create directories elsewhere.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000


41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
$ mkdir src/edu

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000


43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
This command creates a subdirectory called edu inside the src directory. This behavior can be extremely useful. However, be advised that if the parent directory does not exist, mkdir will produce an error message and will fail to create the subdirectory.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000


45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
$ mkdir examples/simple

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000


47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
mkdir: cannot create directory `examples/simple': No such file or directory

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000


49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This command failed because the examples directory doesn't exist.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000


51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
There is a solution. Let's take a look at the manual for mkdir to find it.

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000


53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
$ man mkdir

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000


55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The -p flag instructs mkdir to make parent directories as needed.

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000


57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
$ mkdir -v -p examples/simple

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
mkdir: created directory `examples'

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
mkdir: created directory `examples/simple'

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000


61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The -p flag can also be used so that mkdir doesn't complain if the directory already exists. Recall that we already created a directory called bin.

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000


63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
$ ls

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
bin doc examples src tests

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000


66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
As we saw earlier, if we try to create a directory that already exists, mkdir will normally fail. 

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000


68
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
$ mkdir bin

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
mkdir: cannot create directory `bin': File exists

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000


71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But, by calling mkdir with the -p flag, mkdir will silently succeed.

72
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000


73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
$ mkdir -p bin

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000


75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
In all of the examples so far, we have asked mkdir to create directories within the current working directory. We can alternatively call mkdir using absolute paths.

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000


77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
$ mkdir /home/lanes/code

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000


79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
$ man mkdir

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000


81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
mkdir is an essential Linux command that you will use frequently. You should practice using it to create directories in your current working directory and elsewhere. While you may never use the -z or -m flags, you should learn to use the -p flag.

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000


83
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
