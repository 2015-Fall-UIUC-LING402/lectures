Let's take a look at command line concepts: 

Understanding complex relative paths using . and ..

$ cd kenlm/util/stream
$ pwd
/home/lanes/kenlm/util/stream

Now, let's look at one example of a relative path that uses both . and .. multiple times

Note that the following example is intentionally complex, deliberately made convoluted to illustrate how . and .. can be used within other paths. It may be a while before you encounter an example that's this complex in real life, but it's good to understand what's going on.

$ cd ../double-conversion/./../../lm/./wrappers/../builder/

$ pwd
/home/lanes/kenlm/lm/builder

Now let's go back and unpack that messy path.

$ cd /home/lanes/kenlm/util/stream
$ pwd
/home/lanes/kenlm/util/stream

$ ../double-conversion/./../../lm/./wrappers/../builder/ ^C

.. refers to the parent of the current working directory. In our case, the parent is the util directory. 

../double-conversion is a subdirectory of util. 

$ cd ../double-conversion
$ pwd
/home/lanes/kenlm/util/double-conversion

Its absolute path is /home/lanes/kenlm/util/double-conversion

$ cd /home/lanes/kenlm/util/stream

. is another name for the current directory. 

$ cd ../double-conversion/.

That means that ../double-conversion/. means exactly the same thing as ../double-conversion

$ pwd
/home/lanes/kenlm/util/double-conversion

The parent of double-conversion is util. The parent of util is kenlm. 

$ cd /home/lanes/kenlm/util/stream
$ cd ../double-conversion/./../..
$ pwd
/home/lanes/kenlm

So, ../double-conversion/./../.. refers to /home/lanes/kenlm

$ cd /home/lanes/kenlm/util/stream
$ cd ../double-conversion/./../../lm
$ pwd
/home/lanes/kenlm/lm

lm is a subdirectory of kenlm, so ../double-conversion/./../../lm refers to /home/lanes/kenlm/lm

$ cd /home/lanes/kenlm/util/stream
$ cd ../double-conversion/./../../lm/.
$ pwd
/home/lanes/kenlm/lm

And because . refers to the current directory, ../double-conversion/./../../lm/. is the same as ../double-conversion/./../../lm, also referring to /home/lanes/kenlm/lm

$ cd /home/lanes/kenlm/util/stream
$ cd ../double-conversion/./../../lm/./wrappers
$ pwd
/home/lanes/kenlm/lm/wrappers

wrappers is a subdirectory of lm, so ../double-conversion/./../../lm/./wrappers refers to /home/lanes/kenlm/lm/wrappers

$ cd /home/lanes/kenlm/util/stream
$ cd ../double-conversion/./../../lm/./wrappers/..
$ pwd
/home/lanes/kenlm/lm

.. refers to the parent of the current working directory, so ../double-conversion/./../../lm/./wrappers/.. refers to /home/lanes/kenlm/lm

$ cd /home/lanes/kenlm/util/stream
$ cd ../double-conversion/./../../lm/./wrappers/../builder
$ pwd
/home/lanes/kenlm/lm/builder

And finally, builder is a subdirectory of lm, so ../double-conversion/./../../lm/./wrappers/../builder refers to /home/lanes/kenlm/lm/builder
