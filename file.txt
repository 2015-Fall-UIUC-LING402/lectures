Let's take a look at command line concepts: 

Using file to determine a file's type

Let's take a look.

$ man file

The file command accepts an file name as an argument.

The command attempts to determine the type of the specified file.

$ file /usr/local

Using file, we observe that /usr/local is a directory.

Great. That's exactly what we would expect.

Let's look at some more files, and use the file command to determine their respective types.

$ file /usr/share/man/man1/mailq.1.gz

The above invocation of file tells us that mailq.1.gz is comprised of data that was compressed using gzip.

$ file kenlm/LICENSE

Here, we see that LICENSE is a plain text file, encoded using ASCII.
