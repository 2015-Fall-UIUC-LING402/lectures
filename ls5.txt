Let's take a look at command line basics:

Using ls to list the contents of the current working directory

ls is one of the most commonly used commands.

Let's take a look.

If I run ls with no arguments, it will display the contents of the current working directory.

$ ls

We can now see that this directory contains five other directories: baz, foo, Homework, kenlm and zork.

Let's navigate to another directory and use ls to view its contents:

$ cd kenlm

$ pwd
/home/lanes/kenlm

$ ls

We can now see that the current working directory, kenlm, contains a number of files and directories.


Now let's use cd to change to a different directory.

$ cd /usr

Now, if I run ls with no parameters, it's going to print the contents of the current working directory, which is /usr.

In conclusion, invoking ls with no parameters will display the contents of the current working directory.
