00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:05,470
Let's take a look at command line basics:
pwd

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,660
pwd is one of the simple commands that you
need to learn

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:14,449
pwd stands for print working directory

4
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:21,240
This command gives us the location where we're
currently located in the directory structure

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:29,650
Let's take a look at the manual page

6
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:33,130
pwd prints the name of the current working
directory

7
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:41,780
There are a couple of options, which you usually
won't need to use.

8
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,170
When we run pwd, currently, we see that I
am in my home directory

9
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:56,070
We can explore other places in the file system
and use pwd to identify where we are.

10
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:05,390
Let's use the cd command to go somewhere else.

11
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:21,659
Let's try a few more.

12
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:27,710
You'll see that wherever I go, I can use pwd
to find out the location where I am.
