Let's take a look at command line basics:

Using ls with additional options


If I run ls with no arguments, it will display the contents of the current working directory.

$ ls

We can now see that this directory contains five other directories: baz, foo, Homework, kenlm and zork.

There are a number of additional options we can use to configure ls

$ man ls

One commonly used option is the -l flag. 

The -l flag causes ls to use a long listing format.

$ ls -l

Using the long listing format shows us additional information for each file.

This information includes the file type, file permissions, the owner and group associated with the file, the file size, the modification date, and the file name.

$ ls -l kenlm

The file sizes reported by ls -l aren't particularly readable.

$ man ls

By using the -h flag, ls will report file sizes in a more human readable format.

Notice that when specifying multiple flags, we can either list each flag separately,

$ ls -l -h kenlm

or list the flags together

$ ls -lh kenlm

The above two commands are equivalent.

There are a number of other useful flags in ls, which can be found by reading through the ls man page.

$ man ls
