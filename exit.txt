Let's take a look at command line basics: 

Using exit to end a terminal session.


When you are done at the command line, it is good practice to explicitly terminate your bash terminal session. This is done using the command exit.

$ exit

After you execute this command, your bash session ends. If you were connected to a remote server via ssh, executing the exit command also terminates your ssh session.
