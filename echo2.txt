Let's take a look at command line basics: 

Using echo to display multi-line messages

echo is typically used to display a single line of text.

However, echo can be used to print messages that span multiple lines of text.

Let's start by using echo to print a simple message consisting of a single line of text.

$ echo "Hello, world"

Hello, world

Now let's try again, but this time we're going to make a mistake.

$ echo "Hello, world

>

Notice what just happened.

We typed the opening quotation mark, then typed the message, then hit the Enter key.

Instead of printing our message, we see something that looks like a greater-than sign.

Notice that we forgot to type the closing quotation mark.

Let's add the closing quotation mark, then hit Enter again.

> "

Notice what just happened.

Our message was printed. 

But in addition, an extra blank line was printed.

Do you see the extra blank line? 

It's there.

Let's try another example. 

In our next example, the second line will contain more of the message.

$ echo "He didn't fall?
> Inconceivable."

He didn't fall?
Inconceivable.

Here it should be clear that echo printed a message that consisted of two lines of text.

When entering a multi-line message in this manner, we're not limited to just two lines.

The contents of our message will continue until we enter a closing quotation mark.

$ echo "He didn't fall?
> Inconceivable.
> You keep using that word.
> I do not think it means what you think it means."

He didn't fall?
Inconceivable.
You keep using that word.
I do not think it means what you think it means.

After we enter the closing quotation mark, and then press the Enter key, the entire multi-line message is printed to standard output.
