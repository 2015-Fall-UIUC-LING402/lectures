Let's take a look at command line basics:

Using cp to copy a single file

$ man cp

The cp command can be used to copy files.

cp takes two mandatory arguments.

When copying a single file, the first argument is the path to the file you want to copy.

The second argument is the path where you want the file copied to.

$ cp kenlm/LICENSE abc

In the above invocation of cp, I copied the LICENSE file from the kenlm directory; the resulting copy is a file in my current working directory, called abc.

abc is a copy of LICENSE.

We can use the diff command to verify that the two files are identical.

$ diff --report-identical-files kenlm/LICENSE abc

Another way to invoke cp is by giving cp a destination directory.

$ ls

For example, let's say we wanted to copy the file abc into the directory baz.

$ man cp

To do so, we can call cp, using abc as the source file, and baz as the destination directory.

$ cp abc baz

$ ls baz

As you can see, after the above invocation of cp, the baz directory now contains a copy of abc.
