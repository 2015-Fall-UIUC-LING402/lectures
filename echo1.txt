Let's take a look at command line basics: 

Using echo to print simple strings

echo is typically used to display a single line of text.

$ echo "Hello, world"

Hello, world

Here, the message was "Hello, world". 

echo prints this message to standard output.

Notice that the message was not printed until after the Enter key was been pressed.

While it may not always be necessary 

to enclose the message within quotation marks, 

doing so is good practice.

Let's use echo to display another simple message.

$ echo "In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit."

In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit.

As you can see, the message we gave to echo is printed to standard output.

It is possible to redirect the standard output stream to a file, or use a pipe to send it as input to another process.

In this case, we aren't doing either of those things.

As a result, we see the default behavior, where messages sent to standard output are displayed on the terminal.

Let's use echo to display some more simple messages.

$ echo "The road goes ever on and on,"

The road goes ever on and on.

$ echo "Down from the door where it began."

Down from the door where it began.

$ echo "Now far ahead the road has gone,"

Now far ahead the road has gone,

$ echo "And I must follow, if I can,"

And I must follow, if I can,

$ echo "Pursuing it with eager feet,"

Pursuing it with eager feet,

$ echo "Until it joins some larger way"

Until it joins some larger way

$ echo "Where many paths and errands meet."

Where many paths and errands meet.

$ echo "And whither then? I cannot say."

And whither then? I cannot say.
