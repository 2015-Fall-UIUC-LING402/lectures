Let's take a look at command line basics: 

Using ls to list the contents of a non-current directory using a relative path

Let's take a look.

If I run ls with no arguments,

$ ls

it will display the contents of the current working directory.

ls also accepts an argument.

When I provide an argument to ls, 

$ ls kenlm

it will list the contents of that directory rather than the current directory.

So here we see there are a number of files and directories within the kenlm directory.

If we want to see the contents of one of these subdirectories, one approach would be to use cd to navigate to that subdirectory, and then use ls to view its contents.

$ cd kenlm/include

$ ls

However, there is a faster way.

Let's go back to the home directory 

$ cd

and try the faster way.

Rather than calling cd and then calling ls, we can directly call ls, providing the directory as an argument.

$ ls kenlm/include

In the above invocation of ls, we provided a relative path (kenlm/include) as an argument to ls.

After doing so, ls listed the contents of the specified directory.

We can also call ls using other relative paths, including those that make use of . and ..

$ cd kenlm/lm

$ pwd

$ ls ..

Recall that .. refers to the parent of the current working directory. 

In this case, the parent of the current working directory is kenlm

Let's try another.

$ ls ../util

In this case, .. refers to the parent of the current working directory (kenlm) and ../util refers to the util directory that is within the kenlm directory.
