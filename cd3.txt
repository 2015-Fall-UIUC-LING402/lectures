Let's take a look at command line basics: 

Using cd to navigate to a directory using an absolute path

Let's take a look at where we are - the current working directory.

$ pwd
/home/lanes

Now let's use ls to view the contents of the current working directory.

$ ls
baz foo Homework kenlm

We can use the bash builtin command cd to change directories.

$ help cd

To use cd, we provide the name of the directory into which we wish to navigate.

$ cd /home/lanes/baz

Let's use pwd to verify that we have changed directories.

$ pwd
/home/lanes/baz

Notice that in the above invocation of cd, we specified the full path /home/lanes/baz. 

This style of referring to a directory by its full name shows the use of cd using an absolute path. 

Let's navigate somewhere else.

$ cd /usr/local

In the above command, the absolute path that we used was /usr/local.

Notice that an absolute path always begins with a slash.

The layout of the Linux directory structure is a tree. 

There is a single unique root of the file system tree. 

The notation / represents the root of the file system. 

All directories have / as their ultimate ancestor.

Every absolute path begins with /.

Every absolute path specifies a sequence of CONTAINS relations, beginning with the current file or directory, and ending at the root of the file system.

Let's look at another absolute path

$ cd /usr/share/man

We used cd to navigate to /usr/share/man. 

/usr/share/man is an absolute path. 

Let's decompose this absolute path to understand it better.

man is a directory. We can use ls to view its contents:

$ ls

The parent directory of man is share. 

In other words, the share directory contains the man directory. 

Let's verify this by using ls to view the share directory:

$ ls /usr/share

The share directory contains the man directory.

The parent directory of share is usr. 

In other words, the usr directory contains the share directory. Let's verify this by using ls to view the usr directory:

$ ls /usr

The usr directory contains the share directory.

And finally, the parent of usr is /. 

In other words, the root directory contains the usr directory. 

Let's verify this by using ls to view the contents of the root directory.

$ ls /

The root directory contains the usr directory.
