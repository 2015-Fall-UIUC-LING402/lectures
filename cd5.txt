Let's take a look at command line basics: 

Using cd to navigate using ~

Let's take a look at where we are - the current working directory.

$ pwd

We are currently located in the home directory.

Each user has a unique home directory.

The path of the home directory can also be observed by printing the value stored in the $HOME environment variable.

$ echo $HOME

Let's look and see what other users have home directories on this system:

$ ls /home

Navigating to or referring to a user's home directory is so common, there is a special shorthand syntax for doing so: ~ 

The notation ~USERNAME refers to the home directory for USERNAME.

For example, let's try navigating to the home directory for the user bryce2.

$ cd ~bryce2

We can use pwd 

$ pwd

to verify that we have successfully navigated to the home directory for the user bryce2.

Let's try again, with another user.

$ cd ~rpd

$ pwd

I can also use this notation to refer to my own home directory. 

My username on this system is lanes. So, I can refer to my own home directory using ~lanes.

$ ls ~lanes

It turns out that referring to your own home directory is even more common than referring to someone else's home directory.

Consequently, there's an even shorter shorthand notation for referring to your own home directory.

$ ls ~

When used as a directory, a bare tilde (without an accompanying username) refers to the user's own home directory.

$ cd ~

$ pwd

You can also use this notation to refer to files and directories within your home directory:

$ cd ~/kenlm

Notice that in the above invocation of cd, ~/kenlm refers to the kenlm directory that in in my home directory.

$ pwd

In conclusion, the notation ~USERNAME can be used to refer to the home directory associated with the specified USERNAME.

And, the notation ~ can be used to refer to your own home directory.
