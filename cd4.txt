Let's take a look at command line basics: 

Using cd without options to navigate to the home directory

Let's take a look at where we are - the current working directory.

$ pwd

We are currently located in the home directory.

Each user has a unique home directory.

The path of the home directory can also be observed by printing the value stored in the $HOME environment variable.

$ echo $HOME

Now, let's navigate to a different directory.

$ cd /usr/local

Let's use pwd to verify that we have changed directories.

$ pwd
/usr/local

Now, let's call cd again. 

This time, we're going to call cd without providing a directory path.

$ cd

What just happened? 

Normally when we call cd, we provide a relative or absolute path to a directory, and cd then takes us to that specified directory.

In this case, we didn't provide a directory.

So where did we go?

Let's use pwd and the documentation for cd to figure out what just happened

$ pwd
/home/lanes

By running pwd, we can see that cd took us to the home directory. 

Each user's home directory is different. 

My home directory is /home/lanes.

We invoked cd without any options. 

Doing so took us to the home directory.

Let's look at the documentation for cd to find out why.

Recall that cd is a bash builtin command. 

Documentation for bash builtin commands can be accessed using the help command.

$ help cd

The documentation states that cd is used to 

"Change the shell working directory."

Specifically, cd is used to

"Change the current directory to DIR"

Normally, DIR is the directory provided by the user.

However, the square brackets in the usage means that providing this value is optional. 

In other words, users are allowed to call cd without providing a directory.

When this happens, cd falls back to a default value for DIR.

"The default DIR is the value of the HOME shell variable."

As we saw earlier,

$ echo $SHELL

the HOME shell variable stores the value of the user's home directory.

$ cd baz
$ pwd

Thus, calling cd without any options

$ cd

takes us to the home directory.

$ pwd
/home/lanes
