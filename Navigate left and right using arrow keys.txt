Let's take a look at command line basics: 

Using left and right arrow keys to navigate within the current command


Let's begin with a command that displays a simple message.

$ echo "Hello, world"

After entering this command, what can I do if I want to change what I just typed?

One option would be to delete what I typed, using the backspace key, and then type something else.

However, there is a more efficient option.

$ echo "Hello, world"

By using the left and right arrow keys, I can navigate backwards and forwards within the current command as I type.

$ echo "I said hello to the world.
